This directory contains the JavaCC MiniJavaParser.jj file and the
wrapper class that uses it.

The actual parser, and other files generated by JavaCC will appear in
the minijava/target/generated-sources/javacc subtree.

Using Maven, you can regenerate JavaCC artifacts using:

mvn generate-sources

Note that:
mvn compile
and:
mvn test

will also perform generate-sources as part of their actions.

You can perform the same actions using Maven from IntelliJ.
